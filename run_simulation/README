run_openMM.py is the main code. schnet_force.py contains the classes
used to define a PyTorch model. nn_classes.py contains a collection
of classes and functions that the PyTorch model uses. Almost 
everything is taken from SchNet, but not all of their code is compatible
with TorchScript, so SchNet is slightly modified between schnet_force.py
and nn_classes.py in order to work with TorchScript. best_model is a previously
trained neural network model. See OpenMM_Torch/train_model to train a model
using your own data
